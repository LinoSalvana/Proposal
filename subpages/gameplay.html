      <h2>Single-Player</h2>

      <p> Minecraft starts when you make a new world. 
You are placed somewhere in a randomly generated seed with nothing. From there depending on the mode you choose you willhave a different objective. Creative is a sandbox where you can mess around and use an infinite amount of resources. Survival is a mode where
you have only resources around you and you can die unlike in creative mode where you are immortal. Adventure mode is survival 2.0
except you can't destroy or build anything so essentially Minecraft without the mining or the crafting this is usually reserved for custom
maps in which case adventure mode is more of a tool to prevent shenanigans. Now to move on to the modes themselves    </p>

      <h2>Creative</h2>
      
      <p>This mode is essentially you being a god. You really can do anything since you can't die(unless you go out of your way to find the void) you have unlimited resources at your
disposal, the ability to instantly destroy blocks(not instantly kill mobs), and finally you can use anything and everything Minecraft has even the command block(basically code templates ingame.
This mode is intended as a tool to make your wildest dreams and with enough effort and time, you can make entire cities planets or even galaxies in this mode. If you want to make things on
a grand scale this mode is for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container right">
      <h2>Survival</h2> 
      
      <p>If you want to take Minecraft as challenge this is the mode for you. Take all of creative mode's powers and take them away. You are on your own with the resources 
around you. You have a health bar meaning you can die and if you are in hardcore mode if you die kiss goodbye to that save file. However, this is the only time you can access every achievement 
in the game. So if you are a completionist this mode is in your best interest. It's also just more satisfying as you can see your hard work pay off knowing you 
did it without any powers</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Adventure</h2>
      
      <p>This mode is the antithesis of Minecraft. You can't mine or craft you just walk around doing whatever the map creator set up for you. This mode was designed for map creation and it shows. Like I just said
you cannot mine or craft or even build. It's quite literally a death sentence to start a world in adventure unless you spawn right beside a village and get every resource you need and even then you can only survive
for so long.  Unless you are playing a custom map don't even try this mode</p>
