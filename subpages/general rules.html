  <h1>Welcome to The Minecraft Guide General Rules Page!</h1>

  <div class="container">
  <h2>Single Player Rule</h2>
  <p>The whole point of minecraft is to explore however if there is any general rule that any even half-experienced player will tell you. DO NOT DIG DIRECTLY DOWN. This is because of how this the game handles world generation since it's all random this also means randomly generated caves which means if you dig down you will likely die if dig directly down however you can still dig down just not in a straight line.</p>
    
  </div>

  <div class="container">
  <h2>Multiplayer Rules</h2>
  <p>line.The only other general rule applies to multiplayer which is don't grief. Griefing means messing with players by destroying their buildings or killing them when they spawn. This rule won't always be enforced but on any big server on minecraft this is more likely than not going to be enforced. Mojang themselves also has community standards which to abide by but if basic summary is don't be mean,report anyone mean and be friendly towards others.</p>
