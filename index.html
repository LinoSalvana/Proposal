  <h1>Welcome to The Minecraft Guide Home Page!</h1>
  
  <br><br>

  <div>
    <p>The Minecraft Guide will explain what you need to know about Minecraft, whether surviving in
single-player or playing minigames in multiplayer. The Minecraft Guide has everything you need to
know the basics! We would also like to fill you in on the history of Minecraft as to how it became one of
the most popular games today!
</p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <p>We will be splitting the discussion into four topics: Gameplay, General Rules, History, and Maps and Mods, each having its own webpage.</p>
