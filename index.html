  <h1>Welcome to The Minecraft Guide Home Page!</h1>
  
  <div class="container">
    <p>The Minecraft Guide will explain what you need to know about Minecraft, whether surviving in
single-player or playing minigames in multiplayer. The Minecraft Guide has everything you need to
know the basics! We would also like to fill you in on the history of Minecraft as to how it became one of
the most popular games today!
</p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <p>We will be splitting the discussion into four topics: Gameplay, General Rules, History, and Maps and Mods, each having its own webpage.</p>

    <a href="subpages/gameplay.html">Gameplay</a>

    <br><br>
    
    <p>The gameplay page explains everything you need to know about single-player and multiplayer. Single-player has game modes such as survival, creative, and adventure. Multiplayer has community-made servers but you can still host worlds or create your own server to play with your friends!</p>

  <div class="container right">
    <a href="subpages/general rules.html">General Rules</a>

    <br><br>
    
    <p>This page contains rules often followed by lots of players. We will give you common rules, some written as do's and don'ts. We will also give you ways to lessen or avoid the risk of potentially dangerous actions that most beginners do.</p>
